# SpotiCalendar

[Deployed Site](https://spoti-calendar.herokuapp.com/)

## Developer

[Connor Jessup](https://www.linkedin.com/in/connor-jessup/) - [Jessupcn](https://github.com/Jessupcn)

## About

SpotiCalendar was built using an express server and Postgres database backend, and the front end was built out using React.js and Redux, using Semantic-UI to style.

## Setup

To use this app, you'll need to take the following steps:

- Run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Jessupcn/calendar-app.git
```

## Start

`npm run start-dev` will create the bundle and run the server. Once running, you can find the application at `localhost:8080/`

## Usage

The homepage will build a Calendar for you with whatever events are in the deployed heroku database. For the sake of time, I have hardcoded just a 31 day month into the app in order to focus on other areas, such as functionality of event deletion and updating.
